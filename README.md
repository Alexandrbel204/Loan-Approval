Loan-Approval
In this project I made ML models to classify the rate of approving loans to customers and when it should be accepted and where not. There I conducted EDA to see the properties of target customers and basing on the obtained data structure, 
I tried several ML models to achieve the best result. The best result was given by Random Forest with accuracy 93% and precision 91%. Precision here is more important because in maximizing it we are more sure to work with the customers that are able 
to give the money back which minimizes the risk for the bank of losing money.

My goals for this pet-projects are:

Improve evaluating metrics further
Deploy the model and create interface that shows if you can take a loan online
